If you copy someone else’s code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don’t try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; please don’t let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.\n",

If you ever feel stuck in these projects, please feel free to avail yourself to office hours and Edstem! If you are unable to make any of the office hours listed, please let TAs know and we will be happy to assist. Of course, Numpy and Python skills will also be implicitly tested via this assignment. If you need a refresher, please see this [60 minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) for PyTorch! For Numpy, please see the quickstart [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html) and full API [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/). \n"
